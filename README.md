# Deep Dive into God's Word

This is a study/research compilation of my Bible reading.

My idea is to have a living document that will be updated from time to time according to new understandings, debates with friends and more researches.

I also have plans to use this in quick sessions with people that are interested in learning or understanding some aspects of the context and meanings.

As it is written in [Acts 8:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8%3A30-31&version=ESV)

>30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. 
“Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked. 31 “How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
