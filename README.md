# Deep Dive into God's Word

This is a study/research compilation of my Bible reading.

My idea is to have a living document that will be updated from time to time according to new understandings, debates with friends and more researches.

I also have plans to use this in quick sessions with people that are interested on learning and debating about it.

As it is written in [2 Timothy 3:16–17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203%3A16-17&version=NIV)

>16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, 17 so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

And also in [Acts 8:30-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+8:30-31&version=NIV)

>30 Then Philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked. 31 “How can I,” he said, “unless someone explains it to me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

## Doctrine Statement

I recently found about [Sanctuary International](https://sanctuaryinternational.com) which is a really good church and community which shares a lot in common with what I believe.

You can find more about in their website and also in their [Sanctuary Doctrinal Statement](https://sanctuaryinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sanctuary-Doctrinal-Statement-2017-06.pdf)
