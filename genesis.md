# Genesis

## Who wrote it and when?

This a subject that still provokes a lot of debates, but it's mostly accepted that `Moses` is the author of it, around `1445 B.C`

Some sources also suggest that Moses did not really wrote it all, but, he partially wrote it and also compiled several other scriptures that were written or orally passed over through generations.

As we can find the Bible for example multiple verses that contains the following general structure:
> Genesis 5:1 This is the written account of Adam’s family line.

Which could indicate the people were gathering knowledge by themselves which later was used by Moses.

I also found [this](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/08/world/computer-points-to-single-author-for-genesis.html) interesting NY Times article from 1981, that claims that a computer was fed the entire Genesis and based on the structure of the sentences and words used, they came to a conclusion that Genesis was written by a single author.
(I couldn't find the original paper published by the researches yet)


# Chapter 1 - The Beginning

Here we have a brief showcase of how God created everything, from nothing.

Following in this order, day by day:

* 1st: Light
* 2nd: Skies
* 3rd: Land, seas, vegetation
* 4th: Sun, Moon and stars
* 5th: Sea creatures and birds
* 6th: Animals on land incl. Humans

## Some things that stands out

### Jesus as the Word of God

What I find most interesting here is that when God says for example `Let there be light`, this reminds me of Jesus, the One called the `Word of God`.

In a way we could say that it was actually Jesus performing the actions expressed by God, we can see how this comes together with what is written on [John 1:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-4&version=NIV) about Jesus:

> 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.

And also on [John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&version=NIV)

> 14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

### Creation of Mankind

[Genesis 1:26](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A26&version=NIV)
>26 Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,[a] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

Here we can see God talking about Himself in plural, denoting the `Trinity`

It's also interesting the verse starts with God, the Creator, which is notably working here throughout the first chapter, made mankind in His (or maybe better, Their) image.

And the verse ends with a clear intention of God that mankind was created for **work**, just as He was **working**

### Women

[Genesis 1:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1%3A27&version=NIV)

>27 So God created mankind in his own image,
    in the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.

Another interesting detail here is that God created mankind, `male` and `female` in His own image, so I believe we could assume they are equal in rights.

What changes in future sentences is only regarding given tasks/responsibilities for each, not really diminishing or empowering any of them.

# Chapter 2 - God's rest + Adam and Eve

The chapter starts with last day of creation, the day in which He rest.

And the chapter goes on better explaining what happened during mankind creation on the 6th day.

## Some things that stands out

### God's rest

We have to take into consideration that this was **not really a literal rest**, not as we need to rest after work, for example.

But I believe in someway a type of analogy for us, that he stopped with the creation, the creation task was ticked on His list.

We also have indications in other books that **God continues to work**, including in the 7th day, our Saturday.

[John 5:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A16-17&version=NIV)

> 16 So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began to persecute him. 17 In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working.”

### Eve's role as helper

Following on the same topic of male and female creation, on [Genesis 2:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A18&version=NIV) we can read:

> 18 The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”

We can see women were created as equal to man, both as image of their Creator, but with different roles, being the most distinctive function the `right-hand` of the man, his helper and supporter.

We need to be careful not to use this in a diminishing way. 
It's clear that a helper is in fact, in a way, in some sort of servant relationship with the one being helped.

But we can also see in the Bible God himself being called our helper, for example in [Psalm 33:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps+33%3A20&version=NIV)

>20 We wait in hope for the Lord;
    he is our help and our shield.

With that in mind, should we literally say: `God is less than us, he is our servant`? I believe not, and the same goes for the role of the women.
