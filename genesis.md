# Genesis

## Who wrote it and when?

This a subject that still provokes a lot of debates, but it's mostly accepted that `Moses` is the author of it, around `1445 B.C`

Some sources also suggest that Moses did not really wrote it all, but, he partially wrote it and also compiled several other scriptures that were written or orally passed over through generations.

As we can find the Bible for example multiple verses that contains the following general structure:
> Genesis 5:1 This is the written account of Adamâ€™s family line.

Which could indicate the people were gathering knowledge by themselves which later was used by Moses.

I also found [this](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/08/world/computer-points-to-single-author-for-genesis.html) interesting NY Times article from 1981, that claims that a computer was fed the entire Genesis and based on the structure of the sentences and words used, they came to a conclusion that Genesis was written by a single author.
(I couldn't find the original paper published by the researches yet)


# Chapter 1 - The Beginning

Here we have a brief showcase of how God created everything, from nothing.

Following in this order, day by day:

* 1st: Light
* 2nd: Skies
* 3rd: Land, seas, vegetation
* 4th: Sun, Moon and stars
* 5th: Sea creatures and birds
* 6th: Animals on land incl. Humans

What I find most interesting here is that when God says for example `Let there be light`, this reminds me of Jesus, the One called the `Word of God`.

In a way we could say that it was actually Jesus performing the actions expressed by God, we can see how this comes together with what is written on [John 1:1-4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A1-4&version=NIV) about Jesus:

> 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was with God in the beginning. 3 Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. 4 In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.

And also on [John 1:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1%3A14&version=NIV)

> 14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

# Chapter 2 - God's rest + Adam and Eve

* 7th: God's rest
