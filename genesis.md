# Genesis

## Who wrote it and when?

This a subject that still provokes a lot of debates, but it's mostly accepted that `Moses` is the author of it, around `1445 B.C`

Some sources also suggest that Moses did not really wrote it all, but, he partially wrote it and also compiled several other scriptures that were written or orally passed over through generations.

As we can find the Bible for example multiple verses that contains the following general structure:
> Genesis 5:1 This is the written account of Adamâ€™s family line.

Which could indicate the people were gathering knowledge by themselves which later was used by Moses.

I also found [this](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/08/world/computer-points-to-single-author-for-genesis.html) interesting NY Times article from 1981, that claims that a computer was fed the entire Genesis and based on the structure of the sentences and words used, they came to a conclusion that Genesis was written by a single author.
(I couldn't find the original paper published by the researches yet)
